            <h2>About Me</h2>

            <p>
               I'm an 18-year-old from the Philippines and the 1<sup>st</sup> child in the Lada family. While my family are filled with photographers, I've forged my unique path in video editing to diversify our interests. Currently, I'm a full-time student at Algonquin College, enrolled in the Interactive Media Design Program, eager to expand my knowledge for a promising future.

            <p>
                I'm also passionate about assembling collectibles like Lego and 3D puzzles. Solving them, with or without instructions, is a rewarding challenge. When I'm not collecting, I'm a competitive gamer, specializing in fast-paced first-person shooters. I've even participated in Valorant <abbr title="Electronis Sports">Esports</abbr> competitions, where I earned both money and great memories.
